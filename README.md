# Face-Recognition-Based-Attendance-System

Project Description:
The Face Recognition-Based Attendance System with Confidence Function is a Python-based application designed to automate the attendance-taking process using facial recognition technology. This project allows users to capture real-time images from a webcam, identify individuals in the images, and record their attendance in a CSV file. The system incorporates a confidence function to ensure accurate attendance records.

Usage:
To use the Face Recognition-Based Attendance System, follow these steps:

Prepare a folder with images of individuals for whom you want to track attendance.
Run the Python script.
The system will continuously capture images from the webcam.
When a recognized face with sufficient confidence is detected, the attendance is marked and logged in a CSV file.
Press 'q' to exit the application.

Dependencies:
OpenCV (cv2): For capturing video from the webcam and image manipulation.
face_recognition: A library for facial recognition and encoding.
NumPy: For numerical operations.
Note: Ensure that the required libraries are installed before running the application.

This project is a valuable tool for automating attendance tracking in various settings, such as classrooms, meetings, or events, making it more efficient and accurate compared to manual methods. The confidence function adds an extra layer of reliability by considering only high-confidence matches for attendance recordin
